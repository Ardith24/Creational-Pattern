## 1. Introduction
In software engineering, a Design Pattern describes an established solution to the most commonly encountered problems in software design. It represents the best practices evolved over a long period through trial and error by experienced software developers.

## 2. Creational Design Patterns
Creational Design Patterns are concerned with the way in which objects are created. They reduce complexities and instability by creating objects in a controlled manner.

The new operator is often considered harmful as it scatters objects all over the application. Over time it can become challenging to change an implementation because classes become tightly coupled.

Creational Design Patterns address this issue by decoupling the client entirely from the actual initialization process.

  1. Singleton – Ensures that at most only one instance of an object exists throughout application
  2. Factory Method – Creates objects of several related classes without specifying the exact object to be created
  3. Abstract Factory – Creates families of related dependent objects
  4. Builder – Constructs complex objects using step-by-step approach
